# Original Project (Lab Assignment 1)

Max Temperature in January 2017

This project shows the maximum temperatures throughout January of 2017, every other day. It starts on the first of the month and goes to the thirty-first. On the x-axis is the Date (every other day, with odd numbers). On the y-axis is the Temperature, which is measured in degrees Fahrenheit. While temperatures change, the graph shows that most temperatures stay around 35-45 degrees. The highest temperature recorded was 61 degrees, while the lowest was 16 degrees. Generally, in the beginning of the month, temperatures changed more drastically, like from the 5th to the 7th, where the temperature went from 43 to 16 degrees. Towards the end of the month, in general, temperatures stayed more consistent, staying mostly around 40 degrees. At the very end of the month, the temperature dropped to around 30 degrees Fahrenheit.

Conclusions

This graph shows the maximum temperatures recorded in January 2017, every other day. The x-axis states the Date (every other day, with odd numbered dates). The y-axis states the Temperature measured in degrees Fahrenheit. While temperatures vary throughout the month, the graph illustrates that most temperatures stay near 35-45 degrees. The highest temperature measured was 61 degrees, while the lowest was 16 degrees.

# Team Project 1

This project shows three different graphs displaying January temperatures from 2000 to 2019. For these graphs we used four different days within the month of January (the 1st, 8th, 15th, and 22nd) for our data. This gave a good representation of the monthly temperatures each year. The first graph is labeled as “good,” and represents the data well. It is visually easy to interpret, and clearly labeled. It also shows the average temperature throughout the month. The second graph is displays a “bad” one, where the data is shown but not in the best way – even inaccurately at times. This is due to the maximum temperature being used for the data points; while this is an aspect of the data, it is obviously not a well embodiment of the data as a whole. The last graph is known as “ugly,” and very poorly depicts the data visually. This chart is also difficult to interpret through features like thick lines and too many data points. Together, our three graphs illustrate how the same data can be shown in three totally different ways; and shows the importance of data visualization.

# The Good

This first graph is the “good” graph, and it displays the average temperature in January from 2000-2019. The are several reasons why this line chart is classified as “good;” it easily shows the data through color choice and contrast, as well as being well labeled and showing the data representatively. For color, a brighter blue was chosen for the line. This was done because it’s easily seen – not too dark or light. The blue color also contrasts well and really pops against the grey-scale background. You can also see there are two main colors in the background: a grey and an off-grey color. These two were chosen so you can easily match the data with the year. When you view the bottom of the graph, you can follow its column upward to see the average temperature for that year. Considering labeling, the graph presents three important features: the title (which stands out so the purpose of the graph is easily seen), the temperature on the y-axis (showing its degrees Fahrenheit measurement), and the year on the x-axis. Finally, this line chart accurately depicts the data. Since there is a lot of data, we averaged four days within the month of January for each year – which is the yearly/monthly temperature on the chart. Since this graph’s purpose is to show how the temperature has changed year to year, we felt this was the best way to represent the data. It also allowed us to see nearly twenty years of data easily; and showed the average temperature through this time – shown by the “average” line cutting through the graph.

This graph is the “bad.” There are many reasons this graph can be considered bad. First, it is not accurate. The numbers are skewed right and left, and the actual values do not match up with the dataset. Visually, it is a fine-looking graph. If you did not check and see if it matched the dataset or not, you may think it is accurate. You are able to clearly view the graph and all of its data points; it just happens to be very misleading. Instead of using average temperature for each month, I chose max. But I labeled it average, making it a poor graph. The values themselves are not accurate and that is why this can be considered a “bad” graph.

# The Ugly

This is the "ugly" graph, displaying the values of max temperature in January from 2000-2019. I plotted 4 points for each year (1 for each week in January). This allows me and the viewer of the graph to see the trend in max temperature for each January as well as how it has changed throughout the past 20 years. The graph I made accurately represents those trends, however it is in a way that is not visually pleasing. I changed the shape, size, and color of the line. I made the shape into "step" rather than "linear". It still displays when the temperature rises and falls, it just appears to take a longer, less direct way to get there. You are still able to view where the temperatures are different or where they spiked but it appears softer because of the shape and the size. I made the line thicker. This does not change the trend, just how it looks; it makes it a little harder to see. I changed the range of the y-axis. I made it go to 100 which is well above the range. This does nothing to the way the line looks but makes it worse to look at. Lastly, I changed the color of the graph to grey, which draws no visual appeal to the graph. This accurately represents the max temperature throughout nearly two decades; but in a way that is not pleasurable to look at, or "ugly".
